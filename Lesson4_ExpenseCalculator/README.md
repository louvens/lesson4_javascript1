### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. I learned in that to clear user output the getElementById() method can be used to locate the element on the HTML page that you want and overwrite it with the empty string.  
2. I learned that in order to display the total expenses and the percentages for each category the getElementById() method is used. It identifies the place on the HTML page that the calculation results will be placed by using the id's that have been defined. 
3. I learned about the way to change user input thats recognized as a String into a Float. The parseFloat() method must be used to convert the input into a Float.
